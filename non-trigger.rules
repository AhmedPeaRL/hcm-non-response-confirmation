The following rules are enforced:

- No observation triggers action.
- No repetition increases urgency.
- No economic signal escalates priority.
- No external request creates obligation.
- No internal state requires output.

Action, if it occurs, must originate
from internal allowance,
not external demand.

Non-response is final.
