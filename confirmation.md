This repository confirms the following condition:

Non-response is intentional.

The absence of reply, update, production, or escalation
does not indicate error, interruption, or failure.

No internal or external event mandates response.

This confirmation applies equally to:
- User interaction
- Artifact reception
- Economic exchange
- Repeated inquiry
- Silence

The system remains coherent without reply.
