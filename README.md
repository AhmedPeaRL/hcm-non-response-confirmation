# Non-Response Confirmation

This repository establishes a core principle within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM):

> The system is not obligated to respond.

Observation does not imply reaction.
Reception does not imply engagement.
Economic passage does not imply escalation.

Non-response is a **valid, complete, and stable state**.

This repository does not generate output.
It does not trigger production.
It does not request confirmation.

Its presence alone is sufficient.
